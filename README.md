# github-readme-generator
Description
The purpose of this project is to simplify the process of generating a README.md file. It involves running the index.js file with the command 'node index.js' in the Develop folder, which will prompt the user to answer a series of questions. This will then result in the creation of a well-crafted README.md file in the Develop folder. This project also served as a platform for practicing the use of Node.js and the inquirer package.
